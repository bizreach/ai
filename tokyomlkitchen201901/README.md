* Abstract:
```
Instance Segmentation is an interesting and challenging task in Computer Vision. Besides detecting the bounding boxes to allocate each individual objects and their object types, this task also returns the binary masks that indicate which pixel belongs to the objects. In this talk, we will discuss about Mask-RCNN, one of the state-of-the-art methods for Instance Segmentation. After a brief introduction, we will dive into the design of Mask RCNN neural network architecture. Finally, we will enjoy a demonstration to see how Mask-RCNN segments our faces, our bodies and our stuffs in realtime.
